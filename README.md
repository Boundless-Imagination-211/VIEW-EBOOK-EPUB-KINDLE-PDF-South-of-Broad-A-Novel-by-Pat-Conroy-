South of Broad: A Novel by Pat Conroy Book Review

Name: James Deffke
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Pat Conroy's best effort, and I've read them all!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020
Review: This is a novel about Charleston, SC. The history and the development of the city is woven throughout the novel as you progress through it. You read about the "bluebloods" of Charleston and the newcomers who come and make it their home, but never find acceptance into the small society that still runs it.
Pat Conroy is a superb author whose novels are all both enjoyable and thought-provoking. Somehow, I never got around to reading this one even though it has been out for a decade, but like the others, there is a twist at the end which I didn't see coming. Conroy ties up the loose ends and gives us all something to ponder....great novel!

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Southern gothic
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2017
Review: Even though this can be called typical Southern gothic, the literary language is anything but typical. South of Broad almost seems like 4 novels instead of one. Conroy's stories are wonderful with threads of dark and light about family, friendships, and food, but his descriptions are in a class all of their own. The South will miss the talent of this son.

Title: Another fabulous Conroy book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019
Review: Pat Conroy's writing style grabs you from the first page. His character development is excellent. This was one story that I wanted to continue as I felt so invested in the characters. The book is sometimes funny, often times tragic and sad and digs deep into the "southern ways" of the 70's and 80's and how they shaped this group of friends.

Title: Great book by a great author
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2020
Review: No one writes about th Carolina better than Pat Conroy. Interesting, gripping plot with lots of side stories for each character that all ties in together. Not a dull page! Why haven't I read every book PC has written?? (Challenge accepted)

Title: Beautiful
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2019
Review: A beautiful writer. My favorite writer. Always love to read his books. This novel is exceptional. I could not put it down until I had finished the entire book. No one writes like Pat Conroy. Would recommend his books to anyone. Hate that he has died and will not be able to create any more works of art.

Title: Wonderfully told story.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020
Review: Pat Conroy is an artist. His words paint spectacularly clear pictures in one's mind. I feel as though I would know every character if I passed one on the street. It was a joy to read.

Review: Pat Conroy is an amazing author. His character development is incredible and his story lines weave together such that you can't put it down.

Title: Of life, love, tragedy, and resolve...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2019
Review: This is my favorite Pat Conroy book! It is a rich autobiography of his life and his family‚Äôs experiences in Charleston, South Carolina. Conroy‚Äôs rich telling of the good times, the challenges he personally faced, and the tragedies that shaped everyone living in his jewel of a city. This story will stay with you long after you‚Äôve read the last page!
